    "Anthropic offers two APIs, the legacy [Text Completions API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/complete_post) and the current [Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post). For this tutorial, we will be exclusively using the Messages API.\n",
    "\n",
    "At minimum, a call to Claude using the Messages API requires the following parameters:\n",
    "- `model`: the [API model name](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview#model-recommendations) of the model that you intend to call\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_tokens`: the maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping. Note that Claude may stop before reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate. Furthermore, this is a *hard* stop, meaning that it may cause Claude to stop generating mid-word or mid-sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `messages`: an array of input messages. Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the messages parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation.\n",
    "  - Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages (they must alternate, if so). The first message must always use the user `role`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also optional parameters, such as:\n",
    "- `system`: the system prompt - more on this below.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `temperature`: the degree of variability in Claude's response. For these lessons and exercises, we have set `temperature` to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete list of all API parameters, visit our [API documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post)."

      "\n",
      "- The exact shade of blue can range from a deep navy blue to a lighter, more turquoise blue. This can depend on factors like the depth of the water, the amount of suspended particles, and the angle of the sunlight.\n",

      "- In shallow, coastal waters, the ocean may appear more greenish-blue or turquoise due to the presence of algae, sediment, and other materials reflecting different wavelengths of light.\n",
